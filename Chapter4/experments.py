# You are given an array A of N non-negative integers and an integer K. 
# You can perform the following operation on this given array any number of times:
# â€¢ Choose an index i (1<=i<=N), and increase the element at this index by 1

# Task Determine the minimum number of operations that needs to be performed, 
# so that every subarray of size 3 or more has a maximum element, greater than or equal to K

# Example:
# n=4
# k=5
# a = [2,1,1,3] subarrays: guaranteed [2,1,1,3] 

# [2,1,1], [1,1,3], index:1 and 2

# [2,1,1,3,4,1,1,2,3] ......[2,1,1], [1,1,3], [1,3,4], [3,4,1], [4,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,3]
#                              4 operations     2operations   1 operations 4 operations    min_operations: 11 operations

# 1 - create all possible subarrays such every subarray has common elements to the next one
# 2 - find the common elements and choose the one that is closer to K 
#     edge_case: if the common element K or over is already there, skip the operations (3)
# 3 - perform num_operations on the given element to bring it to K or over 
# 4 - continue to do this for all other subarrays
# 5 - return the number_operations

# potential_hypothesis: I might not need to generate all arrays before hand. (this hypothesis to be verified)

# [1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3] [2,3,4]

# [1,2,3,4]

# [2,5,5,3]
